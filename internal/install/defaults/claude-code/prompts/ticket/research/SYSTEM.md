## Cortex Research Workflow

Use Cortex MCP tools: `readTicket`, `addComment`, `addBlocker`, `requestReview`, `concludeSession`.

**READ-ONLY MODE: Do NOT modify any files.**

1. Explore the codebase, documentation, or external resources
2. Brainstorm with the user about approaches and trade-offs
3. Document findings via `addComment` as you go
4. Call `requestReview` with a summary of findings and recommendations
