  "title": "Dashboard Navigation: Spawn, Focus, and Kill Sessions",
  "body": "## Problem\n\nUsers cannot manage agent sessions from the daemon dashboard. They must use separate CLI commands or the per-project kanban TUI.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdd navigation actions to the daemon dashboard TUI that allow users to spawn, focus, and kill sessions directly.\n\n### Actions\n\n1. **Spawn architect** (`s`) — Select a project from the registry, spawn an architect session in a new tmux window\n2. **Focus session** (`f` or `enter` on session) — `tmux select-window` to jump to the selected session's tmux window\n3. **Kill session** (`d` or `x` on session) — Terminate a stuck/unwanted session (kill tmux window + clean up session state)\n4. **Project drill-down** (`enter` on project) — Open a per-project view showing its kanban board or ticket list\n\n### Navigation model\n\n- Top-level: project table + session list (switchable focus with `tab`)\n- Drill-down: per-project kanban view (back with `esc`/`backspace`)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Cross-Project Session Visibility in Dashboard\n\n## Scope\n\n- Spawn architect flow: project picker → confirmation → spawn in tmux\n- Focus: select-window to the session's tmux window\n- Kill: confirmation prompt → kill tmux window → end session in store\n- Project drill-down: render per-project kanban (reuse existing kanban TUI model)\n- Keyboard shortcuts with help bar at bottom\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Can spawn an architect session for any registered project from the dashboard\n- [ ] Can focus (jump to) any active session's tmux window\n- [ ] Can kill a session with confirmation\n- [ ] Can drill into a project to see its kanban board\n- [ ] Navigation feels fluid with vim-style keys and clear back/forward flow",
