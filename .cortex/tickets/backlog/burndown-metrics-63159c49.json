  "body": "## Problem\n\nThere is no historical data about ticket throughput. Users cannot see how many tickets were completed over time, velocity trends, or burndown progress for any project.\n\n## Solution\n\nTrack ticket state transitions over time and surface burndown/velocity metrics in the dashboard.\n\n### Data model\n\nStore a lightweight event log per project at `.cortex/metrics.jsonl` (append-only):\n\n```jsonl\n{\"ts\":\"2026-01-27T10:00:00Z\",\"event\":\"created\",\"ticket_id\":\"abc\",\"title\":\"Fix bug\"}\n{\"ts\":\"2026-01-27T11:00:00Z\",\"event\":\"moved\",\"ticket_id\":\"abc\",\"from\":\"backlog\",\"to\":\"progress\"}\n{\"ts\":\"2026-01-27T14:00:00Z\",\"event\":\"moved\",\"ticket_id\":\"abc\",\"from\":\"progress\",\"to\":\"done\"}\n```\n\n### Dashboard integration\n\nAdd a stats/metrics panel to the dashboard (or per-project drill-down):\n\n- Tickets completed today / this week\n- Average time from backlog → done\n- Simple ASCII burndown chart (backlog count over time)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Daemon Dashboard TUI\n\n## Scope\n\n- Event logging: append to `.cortex/metrics.jsonl` on every ticket state transition\n- Metrics computation: parse event log for burndown, velocity, cycle time\n- Dashboard panel: display key stats per project\n- Keep it lightweight — JSONL append-only, no database\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Ticket state transitions are logged to `.cortex/metrics.jsonl`\n- [ ] Dashboard shows tickets completed today/this week per project\n- [ ] Average cycle time (backlog → done) is computed and displayed\n- [ ] Data persists across daemon restarts (file-based)",
