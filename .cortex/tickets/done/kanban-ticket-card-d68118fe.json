  "body": "## Context\n\nEarly development, no users. Breaking changes are fine. Do not accumulate tech debt.\n\n## Problem\n\nTicket titles in kanban columns are truncated. No visibility into when tickets were created.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Word wrap ticket titles across multiple lines (no truncation)\n- Display creation date in faded text underneath the title\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Commits\n- `fd37cd1` feat: kanban ticket card word wrap and creation date display\n- `fa4f9ed` Merge branch 'ticket/2026-01-23-kanban-ticket-card-layout'\n- `383762f` fix: remove title truncation in kanban ticket cards, allow full word wrap\n- `c590f7b` Merge branch 'ticket/2026-01-23-kanban-ticket-card-layout'\n\n### Key Files Changed\n- `internal/cli/tui/kanban/column.go` - Added word wrapping, multi-line card rendering, creation date display, removed truncation\n\n### Decisions\n- Titles wrap fully with no line limit or `...` truncation\n- Each ticket card takes up to 6 lines (5 for title + 1 for date)\n- Date format: `Jan 2` (e.g., \"Jan 23\")\n- Selected tickets show date with highlight style, unselected show muted style\n\n### Scope Changes\n- Initial implementation had 2-line limit with truncation; follow-up removed this per user feedback",
