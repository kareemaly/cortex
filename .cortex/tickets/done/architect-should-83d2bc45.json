  "title": "Architect Should Open in Project Directory",
  "body": "## Problem\n\nWhen spawning architect via `cortex architect`, the tmux window opens in the wrong directory. It opens in `~/projects/cortex1` instead of the current project directory.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nArchitect session should start in the project directory that was current when `cortex architect` was invoked.\n\n## Verification\n\n```bash\nmake lint\nmake test\nmake build\nmake test-integration\n```\n\nThen test:\n1. `cd ~/projects/some-other-project`\n2. `cortex architect`\n3. Verify tmux window opens in `~/projects/some-other-project`\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Commits Pushed\n- `77093b5` fix: use project working directory when spawning tmux sessions\n- `8f039c5` Merge branch 'ticket/2026-01-23-architect-working-directory'\n\n### Key Files Changed\n- `internal/tmux/session.go` - Added `workingDir` param to `CreateSession`, uses `-c` flag\n- `internal/tmux/window.go` - Added `workingDir` param to `CreateWindow`, uses `-c` flag\n- `internal/tmux/command.go` - Updated `SpawnAgent` and `SpawnArchitect` to pass working directory; for existing sessions, prepends `cd` to command\n- `internal/core/spawn/spawn.go` - Updated `TmuxManagerInterface` and `spawnInTmux` to pass `ProjectPath`\n- `internal/core/spawn/spawn_test.go` - Updated mock with new signatures and `lastWorkingDir` field\n- `internal/tmux/integration_test.go` - Updated all calls with empty string for backwards compatibility\n\n### Important Decisions\n- For new sessions: Use tmux's `-c` flag to set working directory when creating sessions/windows\n- For existing sessions: Prepend `cd <workingDir> &&` to the agent command since tmux `-c` flag only works at creation time\n- Pass `ProjectPath` from `SpawnRequest` through the entire chain to tmux manager\n\n### Scope Changes\nNone - implemented exactly as planned",
