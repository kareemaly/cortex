The README is outdated and needs to include documentation for the GitHub Copilot CLI agent type that was added in v0.2.0.

**Context:**
- Copilot was added as an agent type in commit 327a7c9
- CLAUDE.md already documents it (see commit 44fa9cc)
- Project config supports `agent_type: copilot`

**Tasks:**
- Review current README structure
- Add Copilot to any agent type listings/documentation
- Ensure installation and configuration sections reflect Copilot support
- Keep documentation style consistent with existing content
