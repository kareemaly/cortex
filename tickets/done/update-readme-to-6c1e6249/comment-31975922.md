Updated README.md to document Copilot agent type:

1. **Requirements section**: Changed from requiring Claude CLI specifically to listing supported AI agents (Claude CLI recommended, GitHub Copilot CLI as alternative)

2. **Configuration section**: Added comment showing available agent options (`claude`, `copilot`) and updated example to show mixing agents per workflow type

Changes are minimal and consistent with existing documentation style.
