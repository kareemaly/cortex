Explored all relevant files: launcher.go, spawn.go, orchestrate.go, install.go, config.go, and all test files. Identified all references to PermissionMode, AllowedTools, and AgentArgs across the codebase. Now designing a detailed step-by-step implementation plan covering 4 files to modify and 1 test file to update.
