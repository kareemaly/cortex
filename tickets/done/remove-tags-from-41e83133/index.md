## Problem

Tags are currently displayed in the kanban TUI view. They should be removed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tags are no longer rendered on ticket cards in the kanban board
- No visual artifacts or layout issues after removal
- The rest of the kanban card content (title, type, etc.) remains intact
