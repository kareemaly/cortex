Completed full codebase exploration. Reviewed all critical files across all layers: ticket store, project config, StoreManager, daemon deps/server/handlers/types, MCP server/tools/types/errors, SDK client, shared response types, convert functions, event bus, and daemon bootstrap. Now producing the detailed implementation plan.
