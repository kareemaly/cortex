Removed the unused notification system entirely. Deleted `internal/notifications/` (5 files), `cmd/cortex/commands/notify.go`, cleaned up dispatcher code from `serve.go`, removed notification config structs/defaults from `config.go`, removed 3 notification tests from `config_test.go`, and updated CLAUDE.md and README.md. -2,074 lines across 11 files. Build, lint, and all tests pass.
