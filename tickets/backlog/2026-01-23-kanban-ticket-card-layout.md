# Kanban Ticket Card Layout

## Context

Early development, no users. Breaking changes are fine. Do not accumulate tech debt.

## Problem

Ticket titles in kanban columns are truncated. No visibility into when tickets were created.

## Requirements

- Word wrap ticket titles across multiple lines (no truncation)
- Display creation date in faded text underneath the title
